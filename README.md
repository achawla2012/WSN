Scanning Bluetooth devices

Milestones covered:

10/31/2013: 
  a. Till now once an app is launched. it straight asks user to start BlueTooth.
  b. App is able to sense and list out nearby BlueTooth devices. 
     (Currenlty added logic where scanned device is added only once into the Arraylist, need to test this case) 
  
Next Milestone: (May be by 1/10/2013)
  a. Rather than asking user to scan devices, app should automatically start searching once the bluetooth is on.
  b. How to do pairing and createbond with other BlueTooth Device.
